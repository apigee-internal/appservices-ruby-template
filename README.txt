Welcome to the Apigee App Services template app for ruby!

App Services is Apigee’s hosted version of the open-source technology “Usergrid” — you may find references to that name in a few places. 

1. First, you need to install the gem for usergrid to run this sample properly. Run this command from a terminal:

    bundle install

2. You will need to make a few edits for this template to work. Open ruby_example.rb in a text editor (TextMate, SublimeText, Notepad++, or your preferred IDE) and follow the instructions inside.

3. If you followed the steps correctly, you should see a confirmation in the output if you run this from a terminal:

    ruby ruby_example.rb
